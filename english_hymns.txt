Hymn 92: O Magnify the Lord with Me

Verse 1
O Magnify the Lord with me,
Ye people of His choice!
Let all to whom He lendeth breath
Now in His name rejoice,
For love’s blest revelation,
For rest from condemnation,
For uttermost salvation,
To Him give thanks.

Chorus
Let all ...the people praise Thee,
Let all ...the people praise Thee!
Let all ...the people praise Thy name
For ever and for evermore
Let all ...the people praise Thee
Let all ...the people praise Thee
Let all ...the people praise Thy name
For ever and for ever more.

Verse 2
O praise Him for His holiness,
His wisdom and His grace,
Sing praises for the precious blood
Which ransom’d all our race;
In tenderness He sought us,
From depths of sin He brought us,
The way of life then taught us,
To Him give thanks.

Chorus
Let all ...the people praise Thee,
Let all ...the people praise Thee!
Let all ...the people praise Thy name
For ever and for evermore
Let all ...the people praise Thee
Let all ...the people praise Thee
Let all ...the people praise Thy name
For ever and for ever more.

Verse 3
Had I a thousand tongues to sing,
The half could ne’er be told
Of love so rich, so full and free,
Of blessings manifold;
Of grace that faileth never,
Peace flowing as a river
From God the glorious Giver,
To Him give thanks.

Chorus
Let all ...the people praise Thee,
Let all ...the people praise Thee!
Let all ...the people praise Thy name
For ever and for evermore
Let all ...the people praise Thee
Let all ...the people praise Thee
Let all ...the people praise Thy name
For ever and for ever more.


Hymn 261: Saved by grace alone…

Verse 1
Grace! ‘tis a charming a sound,
Harmonious to the ear;
Heaven with the echo shall resound,
And all the earth shall hear.

Chorus
Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea:
Jesus died for all mankind
And Jesus died for me.

Verse 2
‘Twas grace that wrote my name
In thy eternal book;
‘Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,
Who all my sorrows took.

Chorus
Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea:
Jesus died for all mankind
And Jesus died for me.

Verse 3
Grace taught my wand’ring feet
To tread heav’nly road;
And new supplies-each hour I meet,
While pressing on to God.

Chorus
Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea:
Jesus died for all mankind
And Jesus died for me.

Verse 4
Grace taught my soul to pray;
And made mine eyes o’erflow;
‘Twas grace which kept me to this day,
And will not let me go Thine.

Chorus
Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea:
Jesus died for all mankind
And Jesus died for me.

Verse 5
Amen.
